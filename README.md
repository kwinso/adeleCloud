# Adele Cloud
This is my very old project. It was created when I was doing programming for like 3 months.
Now I decided to open sources of this.

# Some notes
- This project is not mantained since last year.
- Login & Register Page are not done just because I have no time to style it, but the rest of the app and it's logic is working.
- This project has probably the worst code I've ever coded.

# Setup
- `.env`:
```env
COOKIE_SECRET="yoursecrethere"
DB_URL="mongodb url"
PORT=8080
ACCESS_TOKEN="access token secret for jwt auth"
REFRESH_TOKEN="refresh token secret for jwt auth"
```
- `startup`:
```bash
npm run start
```
